## Hi there 👋

### My name is Linh-Anh Le. I also go by Celia. 
I am a big Djoker's fan 🎾, a gator/shark enthusiast, and a data analyst trying to work her way to a more advanced data science role.
I am currently working in the higher education research and public policy field.

Let's connect and learn together 🙌
